# Agent Instructions

<!-- APP-FACTORY:BEGIN -->
This repository is registered with the App Factory.

Use this context path before editing:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `.factory/repository-map.json`
3. `.factory/project-context.json`
4. `.factory/standard-lock.json`
5. `docs/README.md`
6. Only the canonical documents and feature contracts relevant to the current task

Do not recursively read the entire repository by default. Use the repository map and documentation index to retrieve the smallest authoritative context set.

The `projectType` in `.factory/project-context.json` determines whether new-project or existing-project rules apply.

Before implementing cross-cutting infrastructure, read `.factory/library-catalog.json` and `docs/REUSABLE_COMPONENTS.md`. Prefer a released library plus a thin product adapter; otherwise create a library-ready local module and document it as a candidate.

Do not create duplicate sources of truth. Separate facts, decisions, assumptions, and proposals. Do not mark work `done` unless required evidence exists. Use `code_complete` or `verification_pending` when checks remain.
